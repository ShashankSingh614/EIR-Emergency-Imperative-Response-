Wash hands – Before treating or applying any first aid treatments to an open wound, it’s important to wash your hands first. 
This helps keep the wound clean and prevent infection.
Stop the bleeding – The next important step in wound care is to stop the bleeding. 
For deep wounds like lacerations and avulsions, it’s the utmost priority to stop the hemorrhage to prevent hypovolemic shock, which is potentially fatal. 
Apply gentle pressure with a clean cloth or bandage. Elevate the wound until the bleeding stops.
Clean the cut or wound – After making sure the wound has stopped bleeding, rinse the wound with clean water for about five minutes. 
Make sure dirt and debris are removed. You can clean the wound with soap and water.
Disinfect – To prevent infection, apply a topical antiseptic.
Dress the wound – Cover the wound with a sterile gauze pad with dressing and secure with adhesive tapes.
 However, for minor scrapes or abrasions, you can leave the wound uncovered.
