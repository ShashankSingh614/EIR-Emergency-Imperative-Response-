Keep the person still. The injured person should lie down with the head and shoulders slightly elevated.
Don't move the person unless necessary. Avoid moving the person's neck. If the person is wearing a helmet, don't remove it.
Stop any bleeding.
Apply firm pressure to the wound with sterile gauze or a clean cloth.
But don't apply direct pressure to the wound if you suspect a skull fracture.
Watch for changes in breathing and alertness. If the person shows no signs of circulation — no breathing, coughing or movement — begin CPR.
Head trauma that results in concussion symptoms need to be evaluated by a medical professional.
 Concussion symptoms include nausea, unsteadiness, headaches or difficulty concentrating.
