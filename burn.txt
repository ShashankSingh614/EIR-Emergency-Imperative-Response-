Until emergency help arrives:
Protect the burned person from further harm.
If you can do so safely, make sure the person you're helping is not in contact with the source of the burn.
For electrical burns, make sure the power source is off before you approach the burned person.
Don't try to remove clothing stuck in the burn.
Make certain that the person burned is breathing. If needed, begin rescue breathing if you know how.
Remove jewelry, belts and other tight items, especially from the burned area and the neck. Burned areas swell quickly.
Cover the burn. Loosely cover the area with gauze or a clean cloth.
Raise the burned area. Lift the wound above heart level if possible.
Watch for signs of shock. Signs and symptoms include cool, clammy skin, weak pulse and shallow breathing.
