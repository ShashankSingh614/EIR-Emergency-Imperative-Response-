If you think a person may have a spinal injury, do not attempt to move them until the emergency services reach you.

If it's necessary to open their airway, place your hands on either side of their head and gently lift their jaw with your fingertips to open the airway. Take care not to move their neck.

You should suspect a spinal injury if the person:

has been involved in an incident that's directly affected their spine, such as a fall from height or being struck directly in the back
complains of severe pain in their neck or back
is not able to move their neck
feels weak, numb or unable to move (paralysed)
has lost control of their limbs, bladder or bowels
