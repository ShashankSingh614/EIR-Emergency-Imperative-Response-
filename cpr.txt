 If you're not trained in CPR or worried about giving rescue breaths, then provide hands-only CPR. That means uninterrupted chest compressions of 100 to 120 a minute until paramedics arrive .
You don't need to try rescue breathing.
Compressions means you'll use your hands to push down hard and fast in a specific way on the person's chest. Compressions are the most important step in CPR. Follow these steps for performing CPR compressions:

Put the person on his or her back on a firm surface.
Kneel next to the person's neck and shoulders.
Place the lower palm (heel) of your hand over the center of the person's chest, between the nipples.
Place your other hand on top of the first hand. Keep your elbows straight and position your shoulders directly above your hands.
Push straight down on (compress) the chest at least 2 inches (5 centimeters) but no more than 2.4 inches (6 centimeters). 
Use your entire body weight (not just your arms) when doing compressions.
Push hard at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions a minute. 
Allow the chest to spring back (recoil) after each push.
If you haven't been trained in CPR, continue chest compressions until there are signs of movement or until emergency medical personnel take over. 
If you have been trained in CPR, go on to opening the airway and rescue breath
