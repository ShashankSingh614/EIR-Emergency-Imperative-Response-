1. Begin CPR, if Necessary
If the person is unresponsive, has stopped breathing, or is gasping for air:

For a child, start CPR for children.
For an adult, start adult CPR.
2. Cover an Open Wound
Use a cloth, pad, piece of clothing, plastic, aluminum, or whatever is at hand.
If possible, cover two inches beyond the edge of the wound.
If blood bubbles up from the wound or you hear air passing through the chest cavity, tape cover down on three sides to prevent air from building up in the chest.
Do not remove any objects that have penetrated the chest.
3. Stop Bleeding, if Necessary
Apply pressure over dressing to control bleeding.
If blood soaks through the dressing, apply additional dressing on top of old one.
4. Position Person to Make Breathing Easier
If possible, place the person on the injured side or sitting up.
5. Monitor Breathing
If breathing becomes weak, apply CPR as instructed above.
