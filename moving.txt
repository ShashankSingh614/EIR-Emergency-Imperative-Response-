When moving an injured person, avoid as far as possible, from either twisting or bending them.
If they are lying on the ground, place your hand on the neck of their shirt or upper garment and use your forearms to cradle their head.
Then pull the shirt or garment to drag them in a straight line to a spot or place where they will be safe.
They can also be dragged by their feet, but do ensure to keep their head, neck and spine straight while dragging them. It is very important to keep the person straight and flat, in the event the injured person has neck pain or back pain.
Drag the person in a straight line to a safe spot.
If a hard long board or plank of wood is handy, then the injured person can be log rolled onto the plank or hard board and carried to a safe spot.
For this type of action, a minimum of 4 to 5 people are needed to move the person. Place the board or plank on the ground.
Then one person will need to hold the neck and head straight, while the other 3 people roll the injured person on to the plank of wood or hard board, on to the injured person's side.
The person at the head will count to three and all the others should roll the injured person towards them at the same time, while the person at the head, turns the head to align it with the position of the rest of the body. 
Step two, once again the person at the head will count to three while all the others roll the body onto the person's back, and the person at the head simultaneously aligns the head to the body's position.
