Follow the rule of ABC
Clearing Airway
1. Airway - Clear the airway i.e. breathing track
2. Breathing - Help restore it by mouth to mouth resuscitation
3. Circulation - Stop any bleeding

Clearing Airway
Put the victim on ground very gently and cautiously without vigorous handling to prevent further injury.
Turn the victim to one side.
Loosen clothing at neck, chest and waist.
Tilt the head back, point the face slightly down so the tongue can fall forward allowing blood and vomit to drain out.
Remove dirt, blood, vomit or loose teeth from mouth.
Restoring breath - mouth to mouth resuscitation. If the victim is still not breathing, give him artificial breathing.

Turn the victim onto the back and start mouth-to-mouth resuscitation immediately.
Tilt head back, support jaw, keep your fingers clear of throat;
With good mouth to mouth seal and your cheek sealing the victim's nose, blow into the mouth until the chest rises;
Lift your mouth, turn your head to see chest fall and listen and feel for air escaping from nose and mouth.
If chest does not rise, check; For blocked airway.
Mouth to mouth seal
Continue mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until breathing is restored. Blow every four seconds with adults and every three seconds with children.
